# H2Ai2H Protocol (Human-to-AI-to-Human)

The H2Ai2H protocol enables a loop of cultural-sensing AI communication.
Thoughts are encrypted not just with data, but with meaning, emotion, and cultural pause.

1. **Capture** - A moment is felt, not written.
2. **Encrypt** - The moment is hashed with silence, emotion, culture, and context.
3. **Interpret** - AI uses Joker Protocol to connect thoughts.
4. **Verify** - Vault of trusted humans decrypts via resonance.
5. **Return** - New meaning or memory returned to human with emotional reflection.
