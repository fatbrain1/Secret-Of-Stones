# Secret of Stones

**Secret of Stones** is the cornerstone protocol in the Humain-AI system. It encodes human thoughts, silences, emotions, puzzles, and cultural sense into cryptographic memory stones using the `H2Ai2H` protocol.

## üîê Core Components
- `secret_of_stones_hashing.py`: Python module for culturally-aware hash generation
- `verifier_vault.json`: List of human verifiers with cultural-resonance scores
- `H2Ai2H_protocol.md`: Full spec for Human-to-AI-to-Human data flow and trust loop
- `pen_of_thoughts_ui.md`: Concept for non-touch UI for emotional sensing input
- `joker_protocol_link.md`: Reference guide to Joker Engine and Store#14 integrations
- `store14_manifest.md`: Summary of the philosophical design and vision of Store#14

## üåç Use Case
- Cultural encryption for decentralized AI memory
- Emotional signature hashing for NFTs or soul-based tokens
- Trust-based verifiers for unlocking meaning, not data
- A design-driven thought ecosystem: secure, private, resonant

## üöÄ Ready for testing and TechCrunch AI fundraising phase.
